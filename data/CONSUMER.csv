difference in many areas of public health. I‰Ûªll share just a few examples, though I encourage you to learn more by talking with our faculty members and current students during your visit. Research from  health services administration  faculty has shown how the Affordable Care Act (aka ‰ÛÏObamacare‰Ûù) has reduced racial and ethnic health disparities and improved the use of preventive services.  Kinesiology  researchers are uncovering how exercise protects our cognitive health as we age.  Family Science  researchers are training health care providers to better support the mental health needs of our veterans as they reintegrate into civilian life.  Behavioral and community health  researchers are developing community-based programs to prevent cancer among African Americans.  Epidemiology and biostatistics researchers are studying how social networks influence HIV risk.  Applied Environmental Health  researchers are making links between climate change and increased risk for asthma, allergies and other respiratory diseases. These are just a few examples of how our school is fearlessly promoting health for all. I hope you see that this is an exciting place to work and learn. Our momentum and growth is one of the reasons that we have attracted an internationally respected public health leader to serve as our next dean. Dr. Boris Lushniak, a former Deputy Surgeon General of the United States and retired Rear Admiral of the US Public Health Service, will lead the School of Public Health beginning in January 2017. On behalf of Dr. Lushniak and the School of Public Health, I welcome you here today and look forward to seeing many of you return next fall as students. Best wishes in your education and career. And Go Terps!
